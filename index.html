				      <h2>Hong Kong - Victory Habour</h2>
						<p>Kaws The much-ballyhooed “KAWS:HOLIDAY” floating sculpture installation set sail on Victoria Harbour today, drawing mostly positive reviews — not to mention stares — from Hongkongers enjoying the waterfront this afternoon.

						The 37-meter inflatable figure, an iteration of the street artist and design world darling Kaws’ “Companion” character, was towed across the harbor today to the Central and Western District Promenade, where it was descended upon by selfie-snappers (and a few fans of the artist as well).	</p>
